An insurance company wants you to help them with finding the optimal number of staff that they need for their insurance application approval process. In the industry, the number of staff is considered a continuous variable. This is also called a Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) of the staff. For example, if a full-time employee (FTE =1) works for 50 hours a week, 10 hours corresponds to 0.2 FTEs. If the pay for 50 hours a week is $5000, then 0.2 FTE who may be a part-time employee will be paid $1000 (5000*0.2).

The company operates in three states: A, B and C.

The company can either handle an application with the staff that they hire or outsource it to a vendor. Assume that there is no capacity limitation to outsourcing.

If they hire staff, he/she can handle 40 insurance applications per month when he/she works 100% of the workdays. However, there are days that he/she will be unavailable to process applications due to training, off days, etc.

States A and B have a regulatory restriction that the outsourced insurance applications cannot be more than 30% and 40% of the total number of applications for each month, respectively.

The objective is to optimise the total cost for the application approval process by distributing the right number of applications between the FTEs and the vendors while meeting the monthly demand for each state at the same time.
